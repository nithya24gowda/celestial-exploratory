# celestial-exploratory
Celestial Exploratory is one of the good Computer Graphics mini project topics. The project is meant as a source of recreation where one can sit in front of the computer and have the vision of a planet in space. This OpenGL package is developed to provide opportunities to climb aboard the earth for the adventure of the lifetime. It is aimed to create stars and planets and give constant motion to these objects. The main objective of this project is to show the shadow implementation using OPENGL which include Movement, Light properties also transformation operations like translation, rotation, scaling etc on objects. The package must also have a user friendly interface. The 3-D graphics package designed here provides an interface for the users for handling the display and manipulation of Celestial Exploratory. The keyboard is the main input device used.
